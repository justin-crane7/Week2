    <h3><ins>About Me</ins></h3>
    <p>My name is Justin Crane. I'm from California and I'm trying to get through this program in hopes of getting better at coding and to hopefully get a new job in the future. I'm trying my best at the assignments we've been given but, it can get difficult at times due to time management and my work/life scheduling. I will devote 15 hours or so of my time to this program each week. I look forward to passing and being granted my certification at the end of this program.</p>
